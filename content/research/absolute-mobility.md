title = "Trends in Absolute Income Mobility in North America and Europe"

abstract = "We compute rates of absolute upward income mobility for eight countries in North America and Europe for a range of birth cohorts from 1940 to 1985. Rates and trends in upward mobility varied dramatically across countries during this period. Some countries, such as Norway and Finland, saw sustained rates of upward mobility near 70% for cohorts born from the 1960s through the mid 1980s. Other countries, like the US and Canada, had mobility rates around 55% for recent cohorts. Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK all started with high rates of upward mobility but have seen rates decline in recent years.  Decomposition analyses suggest that high rates of relative mobility in Scandinavian countries did not contribute to their higher rates of absolute mobility. The primary driver was a more equal income distribution between cohorts, with the within-cohort distribution and overall rate of economic growth as secondary contributors."

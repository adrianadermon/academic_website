title = "Equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility"

abstract = "The analysis of social mobility by economists has largely been been carried out in two separate strands of research. The intergenerational mobility literature is focused on estimating regressions which relate child outcomes to parental outcomes. On the other hand, the equality of opportunity literature is rooted in a normative theoretical framework, and has only more recently started generating empirical estimates of social mobility. Intergenerational mobility regressions are empirically attractive because they are relatively straight-forward to estimate, but it is not always obvious how they should be interpreted. In contrast to this, equality of opportunity measures have a clear and simple interpretation, but are very demanding in terms of data, requiring the researcher to observe a large set of variables. In this paper, we bridge the two literatures by estimating both equality of opportunity and intergenerational mobility measures---including intergenerational regression coefficients and sibling correlations---for 125 Swedish local labor markets. This allows us to test to what extent the different measures correlate, providing valuable empirical evidence on the plausibility of interpreting intergenerational mobility measures as informative about equality of opportunity."

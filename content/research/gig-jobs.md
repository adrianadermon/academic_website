title = "Gig-jobs: Stepping stones or dead ends?"

abstract = "How useful is work experience from the gig economy for entry into the traditional labor market? We conducted a correspondence study in Sweden, comparing callback rates for entry-level job applicants with (i) gig-experience (ii) traditional experience and (iii) unemployment history. We also study heterogeneous responses with respect to perceived foreign background. Our findings suggest that gig-experience is more valuable than unemployment, but less useful than traditional experience for majority applicants. Strikingly however, no form of labor market experience increases the callback rate for minority workers."

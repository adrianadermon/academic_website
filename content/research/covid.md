title = "Earnings losses and the role of the welfare state during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Sweden"

abstract = "Many governments introduced temporary adjustments to counter the economic and health
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the importance of already existing government
transfers and pandemic measures to mitigate individual income losses during the pandemic in
Sweden using a difference-in-differences approach and population-wide data on monthly earnings
and government transfer payments. We find that labor earnings dropped by 2.7 percent in 2020.
Existing transfers and pandemic measures reduced earnings losses to 1.5 percent. These average
effects mask considerable differences in income losses, which were, by and large, evened out by
existing transfers and pandemic measures."

I am an associate professor (docent) at the Institute for Evaluation of Labor Market and Education Policy ([IFAU](https://www.ifau.se/en/)) in Uppsala, Sweden. I am also affiliated with the Uppsala Center for Labor Studies ([UCLS](https://ucls.nek.uu.se/)) and Uppsala Center for Fiscal Studies ([UCFS](https://ucfs.nek.uu.se/)) at Uppsala University.

I received my PhD in Economics from Uppsala University in 2013. My research is mainly focused on two issues: long-run social mobility; and the impact of technological change on the labor market.
